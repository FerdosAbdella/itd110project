            <h1>Causes of Global Warming</h1>
            <img src="images/img003.png" alt="Global Warming Causes">
            <p>The primary cause of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, resulting from various human activities. The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest contributor to these emissions. Power plants, automobiles, and industrial processes release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, significantly increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.</P>

            <p>Deforestation is another major factor. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, so when forests are cut down for agriculture, logging, or urban development, this carbon storage capacity is lost. Moreover, the burning of trees and vegetation during deforestation releases additional carbon dioxide, further exacerbating the problem.</p>
                
            <p>Agricultural practices also contribute significantly to global warming. Livestock farming produces large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. Additionally, the use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture leads to the release of nitrous oxide, another powerful greenhouse gas.</P>
                
            <p>Industrial processes, such as cement production and chemical manufacturing, also emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. These industries often rely on fossil fuels and release gases during their operations.</p>
                
            <p>Waste management practices contribute as well. Landfills generate methane as organic waste decomposes, and improper waste disposal can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                
            <p>Addressing these causes is essential for mitigating global warming. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, and implementing reforestation initiatives can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By understanding and tackling these root causes, we can work towards a more sustainable future and combat the effects of climate change.</p>
